      <td style="width: 871px;">Yamaha "Genos" features
CFX and C7 (This is S101, the successor is C7X), Clavinova also features "Bosendorfer
Imperial 290".<br>






      <br>






Since these are either hard to find (G360) or too expensive, and C7 is discontinued, therefore I have
chosen the easy-obtained / commonly available pianos to add in the
queue.<br>






      <br>






I only need the samples from:<br>






CF4, CF6 - The smaller version of CF Series<br>






C7X - Successor of C7<br>






SX Series - Successor of S-Series (Motif used)<br>






Some Chinese Grand Pianos as well<br>






Other grand pianos which are not limited to the specific brands or
models<br>






(Note that I cannot buy those)<br>




      <br>




C7 was replaced by Headroom Piano "C3" (or Salamander Piano "C5"), and
CFX was replaced by Salamander Piano "C5". They're all lower tiers.<br>




      <br>




If who owned 2nd hand of C7, brand new of CFX or Imperial 290, record them and submit to us.</td>
